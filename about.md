*Evented I/O streams for Swift (yeah, a Node.js port)*.

To get started, jump over to our [Start](/start/) page.

    import net
    
    net.createServer { sock in
      sock.write("Welcome to Noze.io!\r\n")
      sock | sock
    }
    .listen(1337)

### Supported Swift Versions

| OS    | Swift | Xcode                                                      | Make | SPM  |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| macOS | 3GMc1 | [8 GMc1](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)      | üëçüèª  | üëç  |
| tuxOS | 3GMc1 |                                                            | üëçüèª  | üëç  |

P.S.: With the release of Swift 3 Noze.io drops support for Swift 2.x. If you
are still interested in using it with 2.x, the last release is still available
in the `legacy/swift23` branch on GitHub.


### Status

- *Not for production*. Consider the version numbers.

- We chose the traditional Swift approach:
  Make something barely usable, though demoable,
  and release it with a 2.0 version tag.
  Then hope that the community kicks in and fills open spots.

- It already has
  [leftpad](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/develop/Sources/leftpad).

- Implements primarily the happy path. Errors will error. Presumably this
  will improve over time.

- A huge strength of Node is the npm package environment and the
  <a href="http://heathersfilm.tripod.com/script.txt" target="ext">myriad</a>s 
  of packages available for it.
  Or wait, is it? Well, at least we have
  [leftpad](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/develop/Sources/leftpad)
  included.
  And we hope that the [Swift package](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
  environment is going to grow as well.

- There are tons of open ends in Noze.io. We welcome contributions of all kinds.
  Grep the code for FIXME and TODO.
  
### Want to help?

Nice, we need lotz of help. Ideas:

- There are tons of Node tutorials, redo such for Noze.io. Or well, first check 
  whether they work in Noze.io in the first place and what is missing!
- There are a lot of node modules, many are really easy to implement. Same for
  core Node API, we still miss a lot of that.
- Tests & Examples
- Do some benchmarking with Apache Bench
- Packages, brew and apt
- Need Raspi installation instructions

### Who

Noze.io is brought to you by
[The Always Right Institute](http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com)
and

We wouldn't be sad if more people would like to join the effort :-)
