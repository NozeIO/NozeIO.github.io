  <b>Noze.io</b> is an attempt to carry over the
  <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="ext">Node.js</a>
  ideas into <em>pure</em>
  <a href="http://swift.org/" target="ext">Swift</a>.
  It uses
  <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch" target="ext"
    >libdispatch</a>
  for event-driven, non-blocking I/O.
  <b>Noze.io</b> is built around type-safe back-pressure aware pull-streams
  (using Swift generics)
  operating on batches of items. Instead of just operating on bytes,
  operate on batches of Unicode lines or database records or HTML
  responses or - you get the idea.
  Be efficient: Stream everything and ÃŸatch.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A focus is to keep the API similar to Node. Not always possible -
  Swift is not JavaScript - but pretty close.
  It comes with rechargeables included, <b>Noze.io</b> is self-contained and
  doesn't require any extra dependencies.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Noze.io</b> works in Cocoa environments as well as on Linux,
  and it works with Swift 2.2 as well as the latest Swift 3 drop.
  In fact we suggest 2.2 until Swift 3 is actually released.

  <em>Is it a good idea?</em> You <a href="/about/">tell us</a>.
  Not sure, but we think it might be,
  because:
  <em>a)</em>
  While Swift looks <em>very</em> much like JavaScript, it is actually a very
  high performance statically typed and AOT-compiled language,
  <em>b)</em>
  Code often looks better in Swift, mostly due to trailing-closure syntax,
  <em>c)</em>
  No monkey patching while still providing extensions.
  <strike>There are cons too.</strike>

  There is a reasonably large collection of simple, focused:
  <a href="https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples"
     >Noze.io examples</a>. But here you go, the "standard" Node example, a
  HelloWorld httpd:</p>
<pre class="code highlight">
import http

http.createServer { req, res in 
    res.writeHead(200, [ "Content-Type": "text/html" ])
    res.end("&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;")
  }
  .listen(1337)
</pre>
<p>An echo daemon, just piping the in-end of a socket into its own-out end:</p>
<pre class="code highlight">
import net

net.createServer { sock in
    sock.write("Welcome to Noze.io!\r\n")
    sock | sock
  }
  .listen(1337)
</pre>
