We are happy to announce a minor **Noze.io** release: 0.5.2, codenamed 
'Basic Nozes with an End'.

The primary news is that Swift 3.0.1 GMc is out for tuxOS and seems to fix the
issues we had before
([SR-2656](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2656),
 [SR-2907](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2907)).
Grab it on 
[Swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#releases).

### Basic Auth

There is a new basic basic-auth module designed with
[jshttp/basic-auth](https://github.com/jshttp/basic-auth)
in mind.
Just basics, stay tuned for more.
Example usage:

     http.createServer { req, res in
       guard let credentials = try? basicAuth.auth(req: req),
                 credentials.name == "John", 
                 credentials.pass == "Doe"
         else {
           res.statusCode = 401
           res.setHeader("WWW-Authenticate", 
                         "Basic realm=\"Cows Heaven\"")
           return res.end()
         }
       
       res.end("Welcome to the forbidden zone!")
     }

### Promises

By popular request you can now directly Swift `throw` errors in Promise
closures:

    doSomething()
      .then {
        throw HahaNotReallyDoingItError()
      }
      .error { err in
        print("got error \(err)")
      }

Such are captured as regular Promise errors.

### Changes in 0.5.2 (from 0.5.0)

- use 3.0.1 GMc on Linux which fixes
  [SR-2907](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2907)
- `core` module:
  - support Swift `throw` in Promise closures
- `streams` module:
  - fix: emit a `readable` event (w/ no data) prior emitting `end`
- `process` module: renamed `environ` to `env` to match Node
- new modules:
  - `basicAuth` module

### Documentation 

In case you haven't yet, be sure to read those [dox](/docs/):

- [Noze.io for Node people](/noze4node)
- [Noze.io for non-Node people](/noze4nonnode)

To understand what Noze.io is about reading the Node
[Stream Handbook](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook)
is recommended.

### Getting the stuff

Well, as usual, head over to
[GitHub](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/releases/tag/0.5.2)
and checkout the `master` branch or fetch the `0.5.2` tag.
Happy Basic Nozing with an End!
