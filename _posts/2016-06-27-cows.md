title: Cows. Lots of cows!
tags: nozeio linux swift server side

I'm proud to announce the most amazing and magical release yet: 
*Noze.io 0.2.10 Cows*.
With a lot of hard work (and a sweating Swift3 compiler) we managed to include
over
[400 very nice cows](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/develop/Sources/cows)
into the Noze.io framework.

Starting today Noze.io doesn't only come with *Rechargables Included* but with
plenty of *beef* as well! As usual you only gets those üêÆs if you actually
link to them. No need to be afraid of the sheer amount of meat provided.
And vegetarians are very welcome too!
(No cow was harmed during the production of this feature, 
 what your code does with them is up to you)

Now you are probably thinking:

> Wicked! I also want to use cows in my code, how do I do that?!!

Good that you ask, to get access to all cows:

    import cows
    for cow in cows.allCows {
      print("Cow:\n\(cow)\n")
    }

To pick a random cow, use `vaca`, e.g. in combination with Mustache templates:

    import cows
    
    app.get("/") { req, res, _ in
      res.render("index", [ "cowOfTheDay": cows.vaca() ])
    }

and then:
   
    <pre>{% raw %}{{cowOfTheDay}}{% endraw %}</pre>

The 
[express-simple](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/blob/master/Samples/express-simple/Sources/main.swift#L94)
example cowardly demonstrates this feature.

### Credit where credit is due!

This is just a Swift port of the excellent
[cows](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cows)
and
[vaca](https://github.com/sindresorhus/vaca)
modules of Sindre Sorhus.
He did all the herding and cowboy'ing.

### Changes in 0.2.10 (from 0.2.8)

- `stream` module
  - Major bugfix: some sourcecode was wider than 78 chars, hard to believe the
    code actually compiled! üôÑ
  - fix to flush callback of `Transform` streams: was ignoring the data passed 
    into it
- `http` module
  - make the `cookies.reset` method Swift version agnostic
  - fixed an EOF related bug in the `HTTPConnection`
- `json` module
  - does not bark on empty JSON input anymore
- new [`cows`](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/develop/Sources/cows) module
- `todo-mvc`
  - supports order property
  - now fully passes the 
    [todo-backend JS spec](http://todobackend.com/specs/index.html)

### Getting the stuff

Well, as usual, head over to
[GitHub](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/releases/tag/0.2.10)
and checkout the `master` branch or fetch the `0.2.10` tag.
Happy cow-zing!
