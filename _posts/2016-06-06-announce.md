I am pleased to announce the first demo release of **Noze.io**!

> "Server Side Swift aS a Service" a.k.a. Zzzzz

When Apple came out with [Swift](http://swift.org/) I didn't particularily like
the idea for Cocoa development -
[Swifter](http://swifter-lang.org/) is much better for this.
At the same time I was also playing around with Web frameworks, including
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).<br />
While there was a lot to like, three things bothered me about JavaScript:
the uglyness of the callback syntax,
performance,
and
the lack of multithreading support.

Swift looks a lot like JavaScript, yet is a very fast, AOT-compiled language.
There is
[libdispatch](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationQueues/OperationQueues.html)
to distribute workloads to other CPUs.
And it happens to come with pretty nice syntax for closures, including trailing 
closures.

1 + 1 + 1 = 1337: Enter **Noze.io**.

Noze.io attempts to bring Node.js concepts to Swift. And that is primarily the
idea of non-blocking, event-driven I/O streams.

As it turns out, the result really looks a lot like Node code.
Original code:

    fs.readFile('example_log.txt', function (err, logData) {
      if (err) { console.error("failed:", err); return; }
      console.log("got data:", logData);
    });

Swift version:

    fs.readFile("example_log.txt") { err, logData in
      if err { console.error("failed:", err); return }
      console.log("got data:", logData)
    }

Properly compiled code, no "`function() {}`" syntax for closures.
I think it looks a little better while still providing all the Swift features.

Long story short: More and more "Node features" got added to Noze.io and it
still really felt a lot like Node++.
Today Noze.io seems to be in a state where it starts making some sense. A lot
of Node APIs are in (streams, net, http, connect, express) - and seem to work
pretty well.<br />
Some ffat pushed me a little to finish things up and release this.
So here you go: <nobr><b>Noze.io v0.2.3</b></nobr>, 
codename "Less than Prefect".

So where are we? A lot of stuff is in. A lot of stuff is missing. This is not
production quality yet. But it is starting to get somewhere.

There is a set of neat
[Noze.io examples](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples/)
you can browse.
An [echo daemon](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples/echod),
a simple [IRC daemon](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples/miniirc),
the obligatory [TodoMVC backend](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/blob/master/Samples/todo-mvc/main.swift),
and more.

Isn't that kinda awesome:

    spawn("git", "log", "-100", "--pretty=format:%H|%an|<%ae>|%ad")
      | readlines
      | through2(linesToRecords)
      | through2(recordsToHTML)
      | response

Looks like something you'd like to play with? There is a
[Noze.io Start Page](/start/)
which explains how to install Swift, Noze.io and some information on how to
get started.
There is a page for [people who know Node.js](/noze4node/),
and a page for [people new to Node concepts](/noze4nonnode/).


<br />
So, what do you think? Like it? Hate it? Don't care since you
are still happy with ~~WebObjects~~ GETobjects?
There is a [Slack team](http://slack.noze.io/) and a
[Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nozeio)
you can join for discussion.

Have fun! *hh*
