Noze.io is starting to get persistent. Publish "Hi!" to Redis.

     align="right" style="padding: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em;" />

Starting with Noze.io 0.3 a [Redis](http://redis.io/) client is included.
Redis is a very fast, scalable and easy to use key-value
store.
One common usecase is to store `connect` sessions in Redis, but it can be used
for all kinds of applications.
Checkout the [Redis website](http://redis.io) to learn more about it.

The Noze.io implementation is a clean-room, Noze.io specific Redis
implementation. As usual it is fully asynchronous, non-blocking and ÃŸatch based.

### Noze.io Redis Client

So how does that look in Noze.io?
We took inspiration by the
[node-redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis)
module and modeled the Noze.io version after that.
The result looks almost exactly the same, except that you get an AOT compiled,
statically type-checked binary. It is also a great demo on how static typing
rarely helps to avoid real-world bugs ðŸ¤“

OK, lets jump in - Connect to Redis, store a key and retrieve it afterwards:

    import redis
    
    let client = redis.createClient()
    
    client.set("message_of_the_day", "Hello World", redis.print)
    client.get("message_of_the_day") { err, reply in
      console.log("Reply: ", reply)
    }

Note `redis.print`. This is a function which can be used as a callback
for debugging/testing purposes. It just logs the err/reply coming back.

Redis can store simple key/value pairs, but it can also store more complex stuff
as lists, sets or hashes. A demo for the latter (essentially `[String:String]`
dictionaries) is contained in our 
[todo-mvc-redis](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples/todo-mvc-redis).


Another feature Redis provides alongside KVS is a
[Pub/Sub](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub) broker.
Think "Slack" or "IRC".
Your client subscribes to some channels and gets notified when messages get 
published on those channels. Sample:

    let sub = redis.createClient(), pub = redis.createClient()
    var msg_count = 0
    
    sub.onSubscribe { channel, count in
      pub.publish("io.noze.random", "Hey guys!")
      pub.publish("io.noze.random", "What is the reldate for is Noze.io 6.3.2?")
    }
    
    sub.onMessage { channel, message in
      console.log("#\(channel): ", message)
    }
    
    sub.subscribe("io.noze.random")

You get the idea.

### New Example: todo-mvc-redis

To give a more complete example we added
[`todo-mvc-redis`](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples/todo-mvc-redis).
It is a sample [Todo-Backend](http://todobackend.com)
which persists the todos as Redis hashes and uses Redis INCR to maintain a
primary key sequence.

Check it out! It actually works :-)


### Changes in 0.3.0 (from 0.2.11)

- new module: `redis`
  - This is a pure Swift, clean-room Noze.io specific
    [Redis](http://redis.io/) client.
    Fully asynchronous and non-blocking. And quite likely full of bugs :-)
  - Alongside: new example
    [`todo-mvc-redis`](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples/todo-mvc-redis)
    - `todo-mvc-redis` is a sample [Todo-Backend](http://todobackend.com)
      which persists the todos as Redis hashes
- global changes
  - All code has been converted to use Swift 3 style types and methods. That is,
    `ErrorProtocol` instead of `ErrorType`, `Sequence` instead of `SequenceType`
    and so on.
    Also: Most code is now using Swift 3 style collection APIs, like 
    `remove(at:)` instead of `removeAtIndex()` or
    `append(contentsOf:)` instead of `appendContentsOf()`.
    The necessary compatibility aliases are contained in the
    `core` module. So just import that and you are Swift 3-stylish.
  - All code has been converted from `dispatch_async(Q)` to the new
    `Q.async()` "Objective-GCD" API
  - Various workarounds to please Swift 3.0 Preview 2, e.g. use
    `sizeof(T.self)` instead of `sizeof(T)`.
- `xsys` module
  - Added some support for `timeval_t`
  - Added `timeval_any` protocol which enhances three Unix `time` value types
    (`timespec_t`, `timeval_t`, `time_t`)
    with common functionality (like `let now = timeval_t.now`)
  - Added a tiny testsuite
  - Added support for `uuid_generate` and companions. Unfortunately this is not
    part of `Glibc` and hence only available on `Darwin`. (Linux has this in a
    separate library, libuuid)
- `core` module
  - Enhance Swift 2 to support required Swift 3 style types and methods
  - Changed `CIDictionary` to be more Swift 3 style
  - Added a debug facility to track core.retain/release calls to debug
    retain counting issues. Core.retain is used to keep the process alive while
    async code is running.
- `events` module
  - `onError` is marked `@discardableResult` on Swift 3 now, but that just
    produces a follow-up compiler warning
- `streams` module
  - mark some internal stuff as `public` to please the Linux linker when using
    generic classes (might be a bug, we'll see how it looks in Swift 3 final)
- `fs` module
  - Fixed bug in tracking the number of active read and writes
- `console` module
  - The secondary arguments to the various console functions
    (`log`, `warn` etc.)
    now take `Any` value (was `CustomStringConvertible` before).
    This means you can now do such: `console.log("stream: ", stream)`.
- `dns` module
  - The callback signature has changed to a proper `(err,address)` from
    `(address,err)`
  - Changed the `family` argument of `lookup` from `Int32` to `sa_family_t`.
    Node uses just `4` and `6` values to specify IPv4/IPv6, we essentially
    allow any valid `PF_` value.
- `net` module
  - The connect options gained a `family` property which defaults to IPv4.
    Previously it just used the first match `dns.lookup` returned, which
    sometimes is IPv4 and sometimes IPv6.
    Now you can specify your desired family.
  - A specific `SocketError` enum was added (was using `POSIXError` before)
- `process` module
  - Swift 3: Internal change: `processInfo` is now a property
- `child_process` module
  - Some bitz of error printing/asserts. Sometimes this seems to have issues.
- `json` module
  - Provided Swift 3 "kw-less" wrapper. That is, you can now call
    `stringify(obj)` instead of `stringfy(object: obj)`.
- `connect` module
  - The signature of the `next` callback of middleware functions changed from
    `(String)->Void` to `(Any)->Void`. In preparation of support for error
    middleware.
  - Added the `connect.pause` middleware. This is just used to simulate latency,
    i.e. you can slow down request handling.

### A word about Swift 3.0 Preview 2

Noze.io builds against Swift 3.0 Preview 2 on macOS.
It does build against Swift 3.0 Preview 2 on the Linux 
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/NozeIO/Noze.io)
is running, so it should work.

*However:* We didn't yet get a `libdispatch` version running against Swift 3pr2
on an own Linux instance. So you may need to stick to Swift 3 Preview 1 on Linux
if you really want to use Swift 3 already.

Our recommendation is still the same: Stay with Swift 2.2/2.3 until Swift 3 -
particularily Swift 3 `libdispatch` on Linux - is sufficiently stable.

### Getting the stuff

Well, as usual, head over to
[GitHub](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/releases/tag/0.3.0)
and checkout the `master` branch or fetch the `0.3.0` tag.
Happz noziredizing!
