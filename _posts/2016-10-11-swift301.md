title: Noze 0.5.0 - Swift 3 only
tags: nozeio redis linux swift server side
---

Good news everyone!
We can finally make a release which leaves Swift 2 behind and works with *a*
Swift 3 on both, macOS and tuxOS. We call that release: `0.5.0`.

This removes all the `#if swift(>=3)` in the source making it much cleaner
and straight forward.
Another big advantage is that the Linux Swift packages now come with
[libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch)
included.

There is still a glitch which requires us to use `Swift 3.0.0` on macOS and
`Swift 3.0.1 Preview 2` on tuxOS. We hope that detail gets resolved when Swift
3.0.1 is released.

### The issue with Swift 3 on Linux

As mentioned [before](/swift3-note/) the 
[libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch)
embedded in the 
[Linux Swift 3.0.0 release](https://swift.org/download/#releases)
contains a crasher bug
([SR-2656](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2656))
and hence can't be used to run Noze.io on Linux.
Good news: [SR-2656](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2656) has been fixed
in [Swift 3.0.1 Preview 2](https://swift.org/download/#previews)!
And a cursery check says that everything is working as expected.

Now of course it wouldn't be Swift 3 if it wouldn't come with an incompatible
change to the language ðŸ˜¬
Please welcome [SR-2907](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2907).
It is a preview release only though, we'll see whether
[SR-2907](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2907) is fixed for the final 3.0.1.

**Summary**:
Noze.io now works with the
[Swift 3.0.1 Preview 2](https://swift.org/download/#previews)
on Linux.
For macOS we stick to 
[Xcode 8](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) 
(you can't use Xcode 8.1b2 on macOS!).
