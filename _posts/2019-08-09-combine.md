At
[WWDC 2019](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/),
alongside 
[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/),
Apple released a new framework called
[Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine).
While the API is completely different,
it seems conceptually quite close to what the core of Noze.io provides:
streams of events, with backpressure support and transformations.

A Combine [Publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher)
is quite similar to a Noze.io Writable,
a Combine
[Subscriber](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber)
is like a Noze.io Readable,
and a Combine
[Subject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subject)
is close to a Noze.io Transform stream.

So what does that all mean for Noze.io?
The broader plan was to eventually reimplement Noze.io on top of 
[SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)
and add its typesafe stream APIs to NIO (Noze.io is currently build on top of
Grand Central Dispatch).
That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense anymore. It seems more viable
to just use Combine :-)

That brings us back to our [ùì∂Express](/macroexpress/) posting beginning of
the year. With the streams replaced by Combine, the major Noze.io feature
left is its Node-like APIs which makes it very approachable to users coming
from that environment.

Feels like with Combine starting [ùì∂Express](/macroexpress/)
makes even more sense!


_Note that Apple's Combine itself is not OpenSource (yet?) and it is also limited
to iOS 13 and macOS 10.15.
However, more than one project stepped up to fill that void, for example
[OpenCombine](https://github.com/broadwaylamb/OpenCombine)._
